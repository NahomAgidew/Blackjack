# Blackjack Game

## Overview

This is a simple Blackjack game that can be played in single player or multiplayer mode. To expedite development time, I leveraged the pyCardDeck library for the deck manipulation and py-getch to handle single key presses on multiple operating systems . 

I picked Python because :
    
    1. It's my most comfortable language to program in.
    2. It's ideal for simple scripts and fast iteration.
    3. Has a plethora of modules such as pyCardDeck to avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Setup
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 main.py`
